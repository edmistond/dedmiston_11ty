    <h2>Hey, I'm David.</h2>

    <p>I'm a dad, husband, software developer, and consultant based in Cleveland, Ohio. I enjoy hanging out with
        my family, road tripping, and relentless learning. I have always been absolutely fascinated with technology,
        and am constantly finding new ways to push the boundaries of what I can do with it. I've been deaf since
        first grade (bacterial meningitis: 0/10, do not recommend), so I'm particularly interested in applying
        accessibility tools such as automatic captioning.

        <a href="/captions">The AutoCaptions Project</a> - in which I review automatic captioning tools from a 
        variety of companies, praising what's awesome about them and roasting them for the areas where they fall short.
