We now return with the latest installment of [the Auto Captions project]({{ '/captions' }}) with a review of [Live Transcribe by Mighty Fine Apps](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/live-transcribe/id1471473738).

**Bottom line up front**: _Great_ app, and the captioning tool I use most on a day to day basis. Depends on internet access to a cloud server for best results. This results in some costs and downsides inherent to how it works. This has some advantages too - you can witness the firepower of a fully armed and operational data center doing audio processing, which makes it _ridiculously_ resilient against background noise, and gives it a nigh-freakish ability to lock onto and caption the conversation you actually want.

I should start off by saying that as much as I love this app, I wish they named it _literally anything else_ because Google has had their own captioning app with the same name (_spoiler alert: future review incoming!_). This means that I start seemingly every conversation about it with some variation of "Live Transcribe, no, for iOS, not the Google one" - but you know, I originally found this by searching for "live transcribe" in the App Store so... maybe their marketing worked out pretty well!

To save keystrokes and bytes, I'm referring to the application in this review as Live Transcribe.

## What can it do?

According to my App Store order history in GMail, I've used Live Transcribe for 2 1/2 years, testing in any and every scenario I can imagine short of air travel:

- I've used it around the dinner table with my family.
- I've used it in the car to chat with other people in the vehicle (to clarify: I was _not_ driving).
- I've used it via CarPlay so the microphones in back pick up what those passengers say.
- I've used it in the car to caption both sides of a phone call held via CarPlay on the car's audio system (again: not driving).
- I've used it at the doctor's office.
- I've used it in the grocery store while talking to the staff.
- I've used it for random conversations outside with the neighbors.
- I've used it to talk to the service tech at the car dealership's noisy service counter.
- I've used it for small family holiday gatherings to follow conversations around the room.
- I've used it at _large_ family gatherings for the same reason.
- I've used it at technical conferences like Codemash and Stir Trek, actually understanding the presentation I'm attending.
- I've used it (occasionally) to caption video calls through a combination of witchcraft and a TRRS cable.

I've never used it on an airplane, although in the basic offline mode, I could... though that would have downsides, which we'll get to.

## What's good?

It's difficult to go deep on all these scenarios; there's a lot of them. What impresses me most with Live Transcribe is what I alluded to above - it possesses a truly freakish ability to lock in on the specific conversation that you want it to, with little effort on your part. Sometimes when I'm talking with someone on my left and the conversation shifts to someone on my right, I'll slide my phone over and it switches to prioritizing captioning that person instead, even with the person to my left continuing to talk to someone else. This helps in noisy environments like that car dealership service counter: the service tech helping me asked me to wait while they entered data into the computer. With captioning running, Live Transcribe started to caption the local side of the person a few places down along the counter talking on the phone. At some point while that conversation continued, the first tech started talking to me, and Live Transcribe _immediately_  switched to captioning what they said to me even with someone nearby talking loudly on the phone. I don't know how they do it, and it's uncanny.

I attended two technology conferences in 2024: Codemash in January for the first time in over ten years, and Stir Trek in May after a few years' break. These were my first two conferences in what I now think of as the "post captioning" era - one in which decent assistive tools like automatic captions are ubiquitous and easily available. My trip to Codemash was the best technical conference experience I've had in my lifetime, solely due to Live Transcribe. Whether hallway chats with friends between sessions, mealtime conversations with my peers, actual presentations, or chats with the presenter afterward, it didn't matter. Everything was perfectly covered. Between the Wednesday night opening lightning talks and the conversations I mentioned, I _easily_ burned 20+ hours of captioning time in two days. 100% worth it.

The best thing: for particularly challenging situations, I have a [Hollyland Lark M1](https://store.hollyland.com/products/lark-m1) wireless microphone system. This comes with excellent built-in noise cancellation and 200 meters of range, so it's great for a conference environment. Turned out, totally unnecessary; the conference center Codemash uses wires their rooms with speaker systems so I could just sit down, prop my phone on my leg, and get perfect captions without doing the "oh do you mind the extra microphone" dance. This helps at Codemash, particularly, because of a culture of "if the talk's not working for you, just go to another" and this way I needn't interrupt a speaker to ask for my microphone back.

Also: Unlike 13-15 years ago, Codemash now has good wifi throughout the conference venue, and good cellular coverage. Even with hundreds of fellow geeks on site, I never struggled getting my laptop or phone connected.

## What's bad?

Stir Trek 2024... was a somewhat different story. Unlike the conference venue Codemash uses, Stir Trek holds their event at a movie theater. They don't have wifi (nor the budget to set it up for a single-day event), and the theater it's held in is a black hole for cell signal (happily, cell service is better this year). This left me, in most cases, with _no_ internet service, falling back solely to what I could use on-device.
