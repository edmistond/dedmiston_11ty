It's been a while since I wrote my [Captioning Tools Overview]({{ '/post/2023/10/captioning-tools-extravaganza' | url }}); since then I've gotten a new hearing aid and made some minor tweaks, so I thought it's a good time to go over this again and discuss what I'm doing, in hopes that others might find it useful as well.

The biggest change: earlier this year I replaced my Resound Enzo 3D with a Phonak Naida Lumity. This is a good change overall - I've used Phonak in the past and overall had the best results with them.
