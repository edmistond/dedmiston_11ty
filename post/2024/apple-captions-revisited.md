Apple recently released macOS Sequoia as well as iOS 18 and iPadOS 18, and I wanted to briefly revisit them to see how they've improved since last year's writeup.

When I reviewed Apple Live Captions last year from an end user perspective, I described it as "the weakest of the available options." It struggled with accuracy and technical vocabulary, and Apple's made some weird choices around whether it will or won't display. So, how does it stack up this year after a new macOS release?

First, the good news: Apple made _substantial_ improvements to the accuracy. It gets a lot more words correct, and doesn't struggle with technical vocabulary as much. It also seems more resilient to noisy situations than before, though it's not as good as some of its competition.

Next, the bad news: the _obnoxious_ limitations on macOS, when screen recording is active, remain in play. If you are sharing your screen, whether that's to use DisplayLink or sharing a window on-screen for work, you _will not_ get Live Captions. Or rather, you will, with flashes of visibility, but mostly you'll get a gray box covering them. This appears to be the case regardless of whether they are on your natively-displayed screen or the one that DisplayLink is driving; you will not get captions. I believe this is for privacy reasons, specifically around having someone using live captions and screen recording software to secretly record a conversation. Even so, it's hard not to feel like it's nickel-and-diming people to try to get them to upgrade to a nicer Mac. I generally commend Apple's commitment to privacy, but I think in this case they need to reconsider how they do it. They are now prompting users regularly to re-authorize permissions for screen recording software (including DisplayLink), so it would be nice if they'd consider extending a similar prompt to live captions.
