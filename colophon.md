This site is built using the [11ty framework](https://11ty.dev), auto-deployed from its [repository](https://github.com/edmistond/dedmiston_11ty) to [Dreamhost](https://dreamhost.com) by [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).

Current plugins:
- [eleventy-plugin-footnotes](https://github.com/KittyGiraudel/eleventy-plugin-footnotes) by [Kitty Giraudel](https://kittygiraudel.com/)
- [eleventy-plugin-syntaxhighlight](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/syntaxhighlight/)

I am platform-agnostic and work on both Mac and Windows, so posts could've been edited on either. Most posts written in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), occasionally drafted in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).

AI usage: I sometimes use [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) or [JetBrains Assistant](https://www.jetbrains.com/ai/) to assist with writing code, or [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) for random experimentation or editing. I (generally) do not use AI for creating actual content, and will disclose such usage.
