Built using the [11ty framework](https://11ty.dev), auto-deployed from its [repository](https://github.com/edmistond/dedmiston_11ty) to [Dreamhost](https://dreamhost.com) by [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions). The site and theme are custom-built with assistance from both Github Copilot and Codex CLI. Typeset in [Fraunces](https://fraunces.undercase.xyz/).

Header SVG icons from [Bootstrap](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/), except for the BlueSky icon which is from their media kit.

I may use AI tools to proofread drafts for wording, passive voice issues, verb-subject agreement, and minor sanity-checking before posting, but I don't use it for content generation. If I want people reading it, I the least I can do is expend effort writing it.

Special thanks to the following authors and their sites for inspiration and information on implementing functionality in 11ty:

- [Chris Krycho](https://v5.chriskrycho.com/) - Implementing Twitter/OpenGraph unfurls
- [Desmond Rivet](https://desmondrivet.com/) - some pointers on cache busting, although I used a different approach
