Built using the [11ty framework](https://11ty.dev), auto-deployed from its [repository](https://github.com/edmistond/dedmiston_11ty) to [Dreamhost](https://dreamhost.com) by [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions). The site and theme are custom-built with assistance from both Github Copilot and Codex CLI. Typeset in [Fraunces](https://fraunces.undercase.xyz/).

Header SVG icons from [Bootstrap](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/), except for the BlueSky icon which is from their media kit.

I use AI tools occasionally in proofing my drafts for tone, excessive passive voice, and other language issues. I do not use it for generating text content, since I believe that if I'm asking someone to read a thing, I should spend _at least_ as much time writing it as it would take you to read it, and ideally more. I don't accept every change the AI proposes, either; I find that AI generally has a specific 'voice' that I don't care for in my own writing.

Special thanks to the following authors and their sites for inspiration and information on implementing functionality in 11ty:

- [Chris Krycho](https://v5.chriskrycho.com/) - Implementing Twitter/OpenGraph unfurls
- [Desmond Rivet](https://desmondrivet.com/) - some pointers on cache busting, although I used a different approach
