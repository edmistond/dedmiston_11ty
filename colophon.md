This site is built using the [11ty framework](https://11ty.dev), auto-deployed from its [repository](https://github.com/edmistond/dedmiston_11ty) to [Dreamhost](https://dreamhost.com) by [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).

## Current plugins
- [eleventy-plugin-syntaxhighlight](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/syntaxhighlight/)

## Editors

I am platform-agnostic and work on both Mac and Windows, so posts could've been edited on either. Most posts written in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) or [Zed](https://zed.dev/), occasionally drafted in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). I often have a local instance of [LanguageTool](https://www.languagetool.org/) running in Docker

## AI Usage

I sometimes use [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) or [Codeium](https://www.codeium.com/) to assist with writing code, and [Claude](https://claude.ai) for random experimentation and editing. Generally, I do not use AI for generating actual content. For example, I may give Claude a nearly-completed draft and a prompt similar to this:

> From the perspective of a skilled English editor, review this file. Does it cover everything adequately? Are there major structural issues in the writing? Is there anything that could be more succinct?

This usually turns up a few minor issues for me to consider and maybe make some revisions on; mostly it's just a good "stop and think for a sec here..." prompt, and gives me a virtual set of eyes to look something over.
