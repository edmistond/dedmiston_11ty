This site is built using the [11ty framework](https://11ty.dev), auto-deployed from its [repository](https://github.com/edmistond/dedmiston_11ty) to [Dreamhost](https://dreamhost.com) by [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).

## Current plugins

- [eleventy-plugin-syntaxhighlight](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/syntaxhighlight/)

The sitewide font used is [Victor Mono](https://rubjo.github.io/victor-mono/); it's a great programming font too.

## Editors

I am platform-agnostic and work on both Mac and Windows. Most posts written in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) or [Zed](https://zed.dev/), sometimes drafted in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). I often have a local instance of [LanguageTool](https://www.languagetool.org/) running in Docker to flag problems like excessive passive voice.

## AI Usage

Generally, I do not use AI for to write articles or generate ideas, but may use it for light editing. For example, I may give Claude a nearly-completed draft and a prompt like this:

> From the perspective of a skilled English editor, review this file. Does it cover everything adequately? Are there major structural issues in the writing? Is there anything that could be more succinct?

This often turns up issues for me to consider and revise; it's a good "stop and think about this for a second here..." prompt, and gives me a virtual set of eyes to look something over. As far as data privacy goes, I don't allow OpenAI or Claude to train on my conversations, but I assume anything I post online gets into a training corpus and don't worry too much about that aspect of it.

GitHub Copilot helped with the CSS on this site; I'm rusty on front-end and sometimes use it to look information up quicker than digging through Google search results, or to do text/code transformations that are straightforward but tedious.
